Factr is designed to provide amusing, but also surprisingly insightful statements by combining huge amounts of disparate location data. We've combined 13 local government data sets as a starting point for this, but have also developed a tool that allows us to rapidly add additional datasets (of different structures) without requiring lengthy manual processing. 

We analyse this data using cognitive methods to extract meaning and provide random a natural language statement about it based on your location. Sometimes this data is as simple as the number of things around you, other times it might be an average or combined total of nearby activities. 
Eg:

"The average parking fine in this area is $61.92. Really makes you think"

Each stage of the process (loading, analysing, language processing etc) is modular and can be swapped for different services as needed. 

Note: For our demo, the location is fixed as the centre of Ballarat by default, but it is possible to use current GPS location by clicking the factr label in the top right corner
